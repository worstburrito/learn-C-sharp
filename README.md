## Variables and Operators
```c#
/* int - integer i.e. numbers with no decimal or fractional parts
byte - integral numbers, ranges from 0 to 255
float - floating point numbers i.e. numbers with decimal places. Rounds off after 7 digits.
double - also a floating point number but can store a much wider range of numbers.
decimal - smaller range than float or double.
char - is a single Unicode characater
bool - true or false */

// Initializing a Variable
byte userAge = 20;
int numberOfEmployees = 510;
char grade = 'A';
bool promote = true;

// Delcaring, then Initializing
byte year;
year = 20;

// Basic Operators: +, -, *, /, %

// More Assignment Operators

x = x + 2; // This could be written instead:
x += 2;

x = x + 1; // This is equivalent to:
x++;

// Type Casting

int x = (int) 20.9; // Type casting 20.9 into an int results in 20.9 turning into 20.
